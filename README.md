# extreme-learning-machines

## Aim
Develop a neural decoder based on Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) for the P300 paradigm for single trial prediction at the population level

## Strategy
1. Use population features to built ELM networks for detection of the P300 component from EEG data
2. Assess performance in regards to time, accuracy, recall and precision
3. Built ensemble ELM classifiers: simple majority voting, bagging and boosting
4. Compare performance of single ELM networks vs ensemble ELM classifiers
